Project Overview:
This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using Python and machine learning techniques.

Dataset:
The project utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which contains information about movies and their credits.

Implementation Steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Merging datasets, handling missing values and duplicates.
2. Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
3. Feature engineering: Tokenizing, stemming, and converting text data into numerical vectors.
4. Model building: Calculating cosine similarity and implementing the recommendation function.

Usage:
To use the recommender system, follow these steps:
1. Import necessary modules.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Implement feature extraction and engineering steps.
4. Build the recommendation model.
5. Call the recommend() function with a movie title to get similar movie recommendations.

Dependencies:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. ast
4. nltk
5. sklearn

Future Improvements:
1. Incorporate advanced natural language processing techniques for feature extraction.
2. Enhance recommendation accuracy using deep learning models.
3. Explore hybrid recommendation approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
