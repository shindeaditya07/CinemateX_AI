# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using Python and machine learning techniques. The recommender suggests movies based on their content and relevant features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**, which contains detailed information about movies and their credits.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Merging datasets
   - Handling missing values and duplicates

2. **Feature Extraction:** 
   - Extracting relevant features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew

3. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Tokenizing, stemming, and converting text data into numerical vectors

4. **Model Building:** 
   - Calculating cosine similarity
   - Implementing the recommendation function

## Usage

To use the recommender system, follow these steps:

1. **Import necessary modules.**

2. **Load and preprocess the dataset.**
   
3. **Implement feature extraction and engineering steps.**
   
4. **Build the recommendation model.**
   
5. **Call the `recommend()` function with a movie title to get similar movie recommendations.**


## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `ast`
- `nltk`
- `sklearn`



## Future Improvements

- Incorporate advanced natural language processing techniques for feature extraction.
- Enhance recommendation accuracy using deep learning models.
- Explore hybrid recommendation approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
